# Real-time Gender and Age Prediction with CNN
Real-time Gender and Age Prediction is a project that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict gender and age from webcam images in real-time.

## Overview
This project utilizes the UTKFace dataset, which contains a large number of facial images labeled with age, gender, and ethnicity information. By training a CNN on this dataset, the model is capable of predicting the gender and age of individuals in real-time through a webcam feed.

## Features
Real-time prediction of gender and age using a webcam
Utilizes a CNN trained on the UTKFace dataset
Simple and intuitive user interface

## Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (for webcam feed)
TensorFlow (for CNN model)
